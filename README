To manually intstall a resolver: either 1) clone this repo, or 2) download the .zip, or 3) download the individual files within the individual resolver folder you are installing.

After you have the files installed locally, open Tomahawk's preferences and from the "Services" tab click "Install from File" and select the .js file for the resolver you are installing.
