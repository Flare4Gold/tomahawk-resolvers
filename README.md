# Tomahawk Resolvers

Supported resolvers are distributed and updated automatically through Tomahawk's Settings dialog.
To manually install a resolver either 
* clone this repo, or
* download the .zip (see .zip button at the top of the repo page at https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk-resolvers), or 
* download all the files within the individual resolver folder you are installing.

After you have the files locally, open Tomahawk's preferences and from the "Services" tab click "Install from File" and select the .axe or .js file for the resolver you are installing.

Since March 2013 Tomahawk resolvers have switched to a new directory structure for easy packaging. Ideally, you should download nightly .axe files, if available.

For developer documentation, see [HACKING.md](HACKING.md).
